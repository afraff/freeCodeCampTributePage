          <h2>Contributions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>John Snow was one of the first physicians to work with and test dosages of ether and chloroform for medical use as surgical anaesthetics. He spent much of his free time testing dosages and keeping track of the effects and published many
              articles explaining the procedures.</li>
            <li>Dr. Snow designed a tool to administer ether and a mask to administer chloroform, allowing dosages to be more exact.</li>
            <li>Dr. Snow administered anaesthetics for many surgeries and child births. When he administered chloroform to Queen Victoria during her last two births (1853 and 1857), the use of surgical anaesthetics became more accepted.</li>
            <li>In 1854, the Broad Street Cholera Outbreak occured. At the time, society believed that disease was spread by bad air (rather than germs). Dr. John Snow discounted this theory and found enough evidence to believe the cholera was being spread
              by the Broad Street Pump.</li>
            <li>Dr. John Snow created a now famous cluster map portraying the cholera outbreak. It clearly showed the correlation between the outbreak and people who drank from the Broad Street pump. Snow's study was a major event for modern day public health,
              geography, and the science of epidemiology.</li>
          </ul>
